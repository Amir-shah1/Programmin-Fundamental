# We are following along this course from "University of Nebraska Lincoln
# How to install vs code and and run your first c file.
# How to run code from command line or terminal
# understand of the code execution of the c program
# How to use githup
# Three different types of comments



# -s will give the assemble code 
# gcc -s file.c
# compile
# gcc; =c helloc.
# view binary / hex 
# hexdump -C hello.c
# All in one: Gcc hello.c
# Run: ./a.out
# comments

# Below are the three commands that are used to add file into your repo
# git remote add origin https://github.com/Amir-shah1/delete.git
# git branch -M main
# git push -u origin main


# Second lab
# concept of stack and heap
# variable naming convintion.
# memory alocation and distribution(how much memory is assign to diffent data types)
# path of slids 
# Arithematic opreator
# order of precedence
# Truncation
# Is C single treated language?

# mised lecture
# Data types
# Different way of printing & writing other number system value
# Maximum data can store simple data types
# Explore <limits.h> libirary
# Typed specifiers <long, long long, short, unsigned, signed>
# Memory allocation to different data types


# lab 4
# find out what kind of specifier is used for printing
# implicit and explicit converstion
# typeCasting in C language
# compound assignment opreator

# class on thursday
# input and output
# scanf & printf
# getchar() & putchar

# so far we have studied 4 chapter in c language
# compelte the small code practics in book on page: 57
# Opreator precedence
# Assignment opreator, logical opreator
# Compound assignment opreator
# Increment and decrement
# prefix and postfix, in expresstion and with assignment opreator

# understanding the flow of our program
# how condtional statement execute in program
# if, else if, else

# Friday lecture
# Discuss logical opreator (&&, ||, !)
#

# lab (2024/10/23)
# nested if else-if
# solve some question related to if else-if conditional statement

# class (2024/10/24)
# switch statements understanding
# fall through behavior (when messing the break in case);
# The condtional opreator (codition? expressio1: expression2);
# max = (a > b? a> c? a: c: b > c? b : c)

# Friday lecture(absent)
# Discusstion fo do while loop
# While
